# Database_Management_Class_Project

This is a project that we did for our database class in which we learned how to use SQL and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. The basis of our database is to provide information for a customer based on their
budget and color preferences. We created a dealership table that contained the id of the
dealership, the address, the type of dealership and the name. We also created a car table
from a dataset of cars, each car has a dealer id as a foreing key, meaning that it belongs to a
certain dealership. The Customer and Dealership tables where made using random name and int generators. The Cars.csv file was obtained from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/doaaalsenani/usa-cers-dataset?resource=download.
